# Eyantra
Eyantra is annual robotics competition organized by IIT-Bombay

Our Team participated in Eyantra 2016 and reached till Stage-2

The theme of the competition was : NAVIGATE A TERRAIN

We have to build a robot with a camera mounted on its body, who can visualize the terrain and find paths to move to the destination.
Initially, our task was to find the shortest path in Square and Theta(Circular) MAZES using OpenCV and Python

All the codes and outputs are provided in this repository
